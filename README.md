# HistoryFlashCards
My project is a native Android app that uses Kotlin in Android Studio to assist users with flashcard study.  The app has three screens: a score screen that displays the user's overall score along with feedback; a flashcard question screen that displays True/False questions with response buttons; and a welcome screen with a brief description and a start button.  Five questions are kept up to date by the app, which cycles through them while recording results.  After finishing the test, users can go over their right answers.  GitHub is used for version control, with frequent pushes and commits.  To guarantee code dependability and seamless app operation, testing is done both manually and automatically using GitHub Actions.
